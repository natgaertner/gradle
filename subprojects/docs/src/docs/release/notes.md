The Gradle team is excited to announce Gradle 5.3.

This release features [1](), [2](), ... [n](), and more.

We would like to thank the following community contributors to this release of Gradle:

[Stefan M.](https://github.com/StefMa), [Evgeny Mandrikov](https://github.com/Godin), [Simon Legner](https://github.com/simon04),  
... TBD ... 
and [Josh Soref](https://github.com/jsoref).

## Upgrade Instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle 5.3 by updating your wrapper properties:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=5.3`

Standalone downloads are available at [gradle.org/releases](https://gradle.org/releases). 

## Feature variants, aka optional dependencies

Gradle now provides a powerful model for declaring features a library provides, known as [feature variants](userguide/feature_variants.html) :

```groovy
java {
   // declare an "optional feature"
   registerFeature("mysqlSupport") {
       usingSourceSet(sourceSets.main)
   }
}
dependencies {
   // declare dependencies specific to the "optional feature"
   mysqlSupportImplementation "mysql:mysql-connector-java:8.0.14"
}
```

Long story short, this can be used to model [optional dependencies](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/867)!

## Improvements for plugin authors

### Use abstract types

- TBD - Abstract service injection getter methods
- TBD - Abstract mutable property
- TBD - Abstract `ConfigurableFileCollection` property
- TBD - Use an interface for Gradle instantiated types

### Factory method for creating `ConfigurableFileCollection` instances using `ObjectFactory`

Plugin and task implementations often need to create instances of various useful types, to provide a configurable model and DSL that is consistent with other Gradle plugins. One such type is `ConfigurableFileCollection`. In previous releases, plugins could use `Project.files()` or `ProjectLayout.configurableFiles()` to create instance of this type. However, these interfaces are not always available, for example in a `Settings` plugin (rather than a `Project` plugin) or in a nested model object.

In this release, plugin authors can use the `ObjectFactory.fileCollection()` method to create instances. The `ObjectFactory` service is used by plugin and task implementations to create objects of various useful types. This now includes instances of `ConfigurableFileCollection`.

## Default JaCoCo version upgraded to 0.8.3

[The JaCoCo plugin](userguide/jacoco_plugin.html) has been upgraded to use [JaCoCo version 0.8.3](http://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/changes.html) instead of 0.8.2 by default.

## Promoted features

## Fixed issues

## Known issues

Known issues are problems that were discovered post release that are directly related to changes made in this release.

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 6.0). See the User Manual section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

### Incubating method `ProjectLayout.configurableFiles()` replaced by `ObjectFactory.fileCollection()`

The method `ProjectLayout.configurableFiles()` is now deprecated, and will be removed in Gradle 6.0. You should use `ObjectFactory.fileCollection()` instead.

### Breaking changes

<!-- summary and links -->

See the [Gradle 5.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_5.html#changes_5.3) to learn about breaking changes and considerations when upgrading to Gradle 5.3.
